This is the software component for my entry to [ShmooCon][con]'s 2016 [Barcode Shmarcode][rules] contest.
The theme this year is bicycles.

This code is to be run on an ST [STM32F429IDISCOVERY][board] board.
(The same one used for the development of the software stack for the [Cryptech][cryptech] project.)

This project includes code from [libopencm3][ocm3].
